For weighting/select...

Pass in a substring and a word.
  Loop through the trie until the end of the substring
    Look at the children... do any of them match the word being passed in?
    If so, continue down the trie to that node and increase its counter

In suggest, when returning suggestionList, push most weighted words to the front of the array


I think what this feature is really doing is saying "hey, when I type in this substring,
you return this array of words... I want to upvote the word I like, so that next time I
look for it, it comes up first."

This means changing where the suggestionList is kept; it probably shouldn't be a thing that
is stored, it should just be a thing that is returned when the function is called.

That way, the words dictate where shit shows up.

run suggest on substring, but grab the array
then, compare word with array
